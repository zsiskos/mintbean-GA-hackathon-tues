## Mintbean / General Assembly Hackathon - Day 1 (Tuesday)

For this Hackathon, our objetive was to build a markdown editor in 4 hours. I used HTML, CSS, JS and [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to build a cute, responsive editor that will convert and reset. 

It's my first attempt at a styling with darker colors. And my favourite part is the little animation on the convert button. Don't take my word for it, [go check it out yourself!](https://zsiskos.github.io/mintbean-GA-hackathon-tues/)
